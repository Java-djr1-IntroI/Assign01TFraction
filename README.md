**Assign 01 - Fraction Calculator**

**Date assigned:**

**Program due:**

**Points:**

**This is an individual assignment.**

**Goals:**

1.  Write a complete program using IntelliJ IDEA

2.  Use GitHub for version control

3.  Implement a program that uses input & output as well
    arithmetic operators

If you run into any problems with this assignment, it is important that
you come and see me or a tutor [early]{.ul} so that we can help. Also,
it is very important for you to do this assignment on your own. Every
assignment you will be doing from now on will require the techniques you
learned in class and in the lab. Tutors will answer specific questions
but will not write chunks of your code.

**Here is the problem that you are to solve**

> Young grade-schoolers often have trouble adding factions. You are to
> write a complete C++ program that will give the grade-schooler the
> ability to enter any two fractions. As output, your program is to
> print the two fractions and their sum as a fraction (this fraction
> will **not** be reduced to lowest terms). You can assume that the
> value zero is never entered for the denominator and that each
> numerator and denominator will be a whole number.

Here is exactly what your program is to output (asterisks and all), and
user input is in **bold**:

<pre>
***********************
* Fraction Calculator *
***********************

Enter Fraction #1: <b>1/2</b>
Enter Fraction #2: <b>2/3</b>

1/2 + 2/3 = 7/6

</pre>

**To complete this assignment you must submit the following:**

1.  **An electronic Solution of your program on GitHub**

    a.  You are to click on the Assign01 Link to accept this
        assignment. Once accepted, code up a
        complete solution to the above assignment specification. Your
        complete solution is to be pushed to GitHub no later than the
        date and time specified above for your specific section. I will
        only grade your solution from the proper location on GitHub.

    b.  Pay attention to the example output above. Your program's output
        must look **exactly** like the example output! The spacing and
        newlines in your output must match exactly.

    c.  Make sure that your program compiles and runs correctly with no
        errors and no warnings. If you get any errors, double check that
        you typed everything correctly. Be aware that C++ is
        case-sensitive.

2.  **An electronic copy of your program (punetidAssign01FractionCalculator.pdf) is to be emailed to ryandj@pacificu.edu**
